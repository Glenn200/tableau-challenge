Phenomenon 1 -- Gender Distribution of Trips
The gender breakdown of users of CitiBike reflects a large dominance by male users. This would suggest that marketing efforts to increase the percentage of female riders have not been executed or the marketing team needs to revisit the target audience.The other notable observation from the gender data is the increasing representation of those with gender listed as "Unknown". As users supply their own gender, this would possibly indicate more users are unwilling to share gender or they be only one off customers. Usage seems to peek for male and female customers in October. Where the unknowns peek in August, maybe indicating the reaching the end of the vacation period.

Phenomenon 2 -- Peak Hours in Summer and Winter
The peak hours in the winter months are consistently between 0700-0900 and 1700-1900, with a big drop in March through June likely due to the effect of COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns, working from home and so on. The peaks in the summer months are similar, although usage is much higher, and the hours extend to 1600 and 2000. This is likely due to the warmer weather and longer daylight hours of summer giving more time in which it is feasible to use Citi Bike. The two peak periods during the day in both summer and winter also reflect hours in which users are evidently commuting to and from their workplaces. More efforts to market the ease of using Citi Bike for travelling to and from work environments could prove to increase usage, visibility and profitability for the company.
